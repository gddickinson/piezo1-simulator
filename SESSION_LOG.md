## Session 1 — 2026-08-05

### Goal
Establish the project: research PIEZO1 thoroughly, acquire all structural and
sequence data, choose the technology stack, and build the foundation layers.

### Environment decisions

**Conda environment `piezo1` (Python 3.11.15).** Created by
`scripts/create_env.sh`. Scientific core from conda-forge (numpy 2.4.6,
scipy 1.17.1, numba 0.66, MDAnalysis 2.10, mdtraj 1.11.1, OpenMM 8.5.2,
pdbfixer, biotite 1.4, Biopython 1.87, scikit-image 0.26, networkx 3.6);
GUI/GL and structural-bioinformatics layer from pip (PyQt6, moderngl 5.12,
PyOpenGL, pyqtgraph 0.14, ProDy 2.6.1, pydssp, freesasa). All 21 imports
verified working on macOS ARM.

**Renderer: moderngl + QOpenGLWidget on PyQt6, OpenGL 4.1 core.**
This was the highest-risk decision, so it was de-risked first with a probe
before any renderer code was written. Result on this machine (Apple M1 Max):
context reports `4.1 Metal - 90.5`, and a fragment shader writing
`gl_FragDepth` compiles. That last point is what matters — it means ray-cast
**impostor** rendering is available, so spheres and cylinders can be drawn as
screen-space quads with per-pixel-exact geometry instead of tessellated meshes.
That is how PyMOL, VMD and ChimeraX get their speed, and it is the difference
between 120k atoms being interactive and being a slideshow.
Rejected: VTK (heavy, harder to style, awkward instancing), pyqtgraph.opengl
(too limited for custom shaders), Qt3D (immature Python bindings), embedding a
web renderer (loses direct access to our numpy arrays).

### Data acquired

- **UniProt**: human Q92508 (2521 aa, verified) and mouse E2JF22 (2547 aa),
  FASTA + full JSON. 38 transmembrane segments annotated per protomer, plus
  topology, PTMs, disulfide C2411–C2415, coiled coil 1339–1368, and 26 natural
  variants with disease annotations.
- **RCSB**: a targeted query (by UniProt accession *and* by entity description,
  rather than free text, which returned 236 mostly irrelevant hits) found
  **28 PIEZO entries**. 21 downloaded as mmCIF. The find that matters most:
  **human PIEZO1 structures now exist** — 8YEZ (3.3 Å apo), 8ZU3 (3.1 Å
  PIEZO1–MDFIC), and, remarkably, **cryo-EM structures of three disease
  variants**: 8YFG (R2456H), 8ZU8/8YFC (A1988V) and 9VMX (E756del). Earlier
  work in this field was almost entirely mouse.
- **Curved/flattened pairs** suitable as morphing endpoints: 7WLT/7WLU (mouse in
  bilayer, 2022) and 11YE/11ZC (mouse in plasma-membrane vesicles, 2026).
- **AlphaFold DB**: `AF-Q92508-F1-model_v6`. Note the v4 URLs 404 — the current
  version is **v6** (created 2025-08-01) and must be discovered via the API
  endpoint, not guessed. This model covers residues 1–2521, which matters
  because no experimental structure resolves the distal blade below ~570.

### Code written

`config.py`, `io/cif_reader.py`, `core/structure.py`,
`structure/superpose.py`, `structure/geometry.py`,
`scripts/build_uniprot_annotations.py`.

**Why a custom mmCIF reader rather than Biopython.** Biopython allocates a
Python object per atom. For a 34k-atom PIEZO1 trimer — and we will load several
at once, plus morph trajectories — that is the wrong shape entirely. The custom
reader walks the file once into contiguous numpy arrays and takes ~0.6 s.
Selections then become boolean masks and coordinate maths becomes vectorised,
which is what both the renderer and the elastic-network model want anyway.

*Bug worth remembering:* the first version of the tokenizer treated only space
and tab as whitespace, so the trailing newline of each `_atom_site` row became a
22nd token and silently shifted every subsequent row by one column. It surfaced
as `invalid literal for int(): 'ATOM'`. Whitespace handling in hand-written
parsers deserves a test — one is planned in `tests/test_cif_reader.py`.

### Scientific validation achieved

The dome-geometry pipeline was checked against the literature rather than
assumed correct. Taking the mid-point of each of the 38 transmembrane helices in
each protomer as a sample of the mid-membrane surface, recovering the three-fold
axis, and fitting a sphere gives:

| Structure | State | Radius of curvature | Dome depth | Excess area |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7WLT | curved, bilayer | **9.7 nm** | 4.9 nm | 256 nm² |
| 11YE | curved, PM vesicle | **10.4 nm** | 4.6 nm | 293 nm² |
| 8YEZ | human apo | 12.0 nm | 5.8 nm | 279 nm² |
| 8ZU3 | human + MDFIC | 12.5 nm | 5.4 nm | 270 nm² |
| 7WLU | flattened | 18.4 nm | 2.5 nm | 379 nm² |
| 11ZC | flat, PM vesicle | 21.6 nm | 3.5 nm | 335 nm² |

Published value for the closed state is **10.2 nm** (Haselwandter & MacKinnon
2018, eLife), and ~11.8 nm outside-in (Vaisey & MacKinnon 2026). Our 9.7 and
10.4 nm land squarely there, and the curved→flat contrast is unambiguous. C3
axis recovery is exact (120.00°, 0.00 Å RMSD). **This is now the standing
regression test for the geometry pipeline.**

*Known caveat:* the curved and flattened entries resolve different residue
ranges (7WLT 784–2547, 7WLU 576–2547), so their footprint radii are not directly
comparable. A fair comparison must restrict both to the commonly resolved
residues — to be implemented alongside the morphing code.

### Research

Six parallel literature-research agents were dispatched, writing dossiers to
`ref/research/`. The first wave hit an API session limit and was relaunched
against REST endpoints (Europe PMC, UniProt, RCSB, PubChem) instead of web
search, which had also been exhausted. The lipid-modulation dossier completed
and is a strong result: it supplies the membrane parameters (κ = 20–25 k_BT,
footprint decay λ = 14 nm, ΔA values), ligand potencies, and the important
2026 finding from Vaisey & MacKinnon that mechanical force alone is *not*
sufficient to gate PIEZO1 — a specific lipid cofactor is also required.

### Next

Sequence numbering map (human↔mouse), the annotation layer, then the elastic
network model, then the renderer.
