## Session 1 — 2026-08-05

### Goal
Establish the project: research PIEZO1 thoroughly, acquire all structural and
sequence data, choose the technology stack, and build the foundation layers.

### Environment decisions

**Conda environment `piezo1` (Python 3.11.15).** Created by
`scripts/create_env.sh`. Scientific core from conda-forge (numpy 2.4.6,
scipy 1.17.1, numba 0.66, MDAnalysis 2.10, mdtraj 1.11.1, OpenMM 8.5.2,
pdbfixer, biotite 1.4, Biopython 1.87, scikit-image 0.26, networkx 3.6);
GUI/GL and structural-bioinformatics layer from pip (PyQt6, moderngl 5.12,
PyOpenGL, pyqtgraph 0.14, ProDy 2.6.1, pydssp, freesasa). All 21 imports
verified working on macOS ARM.

**Renderer: moderngl + QOpenGLWidget on PyQt6, OpenGL 4.1 core.**
This was the highest-risk decision, so it was de-risked first with a probe
before any renderer code was written. Result on this machine (Apple M1 Max):
context reports `4.1 Metal - 90.5`, and a fragment shader writing
`gl_FragDepth` compiles. That last point is what matters — it means ray-cast
**impostor** rendering is available, so spheres and cylinders can be drawn as
screen-space quads with per-pixel-exact geometry instead of tessellated meshes.
That is how PyMOL, VMD and ChimeraX get their speed, and it is the difference
between 120k atoms being interactive and being a slideshow.
Rejected: VTK (heavy, harder to style, awkward instancing), pyqtgraph.opengl
(too limited for custom shaders), Qt3D (immature Python bindings), embedding a
web renderer (loses direct access to our numpy arrays).

### Data acquired

- **UniProt**: human Q92508 (2521 aa, verified) and mouse E2JF22 (2547 aa),
  FASTA + full JSON. 38 transmembrane segments annotated per protomer, plus
  topology, PTMs, disulfide C2411–C2415, coiled coil 1339–1368, and 26 natural
  variants with disease annotations.
- **RCSB**: a targeted query (by UniProt accession *and* by entity description,
  rather than free text, which returned 236 mostly irrelevant hits) found
  **28 PIEZO entries**. 21 downloaded as mmCIF. The find that matters most:
  **human PIEZO1 structures now exist** — 8YEZ (3.3 Å apo), 8ZU3 (3.1 Å
  PIEZO1–MDFIC), and, remarkably, **cryo-EM structures of three disease
  variants**: 8YFG (R2456H), 8ZU8/8YFC (A1988V) and 9VMX (E756del). Earlier
  work in this field was almost entirely mouse.
- **Curved/flattened pairs** suitable as morphing endpoints: 7WLT/7WLU (mouse in
  bilayer, 2022) and 11YE/11ZC (mouse in plasma-membrane vesicles, 2026).
- **AlphaFold DB**: `AF-Q92508-F1-model_v6`. Note the v4 URLs 404 — the current
  version is **v6** (created 2025-08-01) and must be discovered via the API
  endpoint, not guessed. This model covers residues 1–2521, which matters
  because no experimental structure resolves the distal blade below ~570.

### Code written

`config.py`, `io/cif_reader.py`, `core/structure.py`,
`structure/superpose.py`, `structure/geometry.py`,
`scripts/build_uniprot_annotations.py`.

**Why a custom mmCIF reader rather than Biopython.** Biopython allocates a
Python object per atom. For a 34k-atom PIEZO1 trimer — and we will load several
at once, plus morph trajectories — that is the wrong shape entirely. The custom
reader walks the file once into contiguous numpy arrays and takes ~0.6 s.
Selections then become boolean masks and coordinate maths becomes vectorised,
which is what both the renderer and the elastic-network model want anyway.

*Bug worth remembering:* the first version of the tokenizer treated only space
and tab as whitespace, so the trailing newline of each `_atom_site` row became a
22nd token and silently shifted every subsequent row by one column. It surfaced
as `invalid literal for int(): 'ATOM'`. Whitespace handling in hand-written
parsers deserves a test — one is planned in `tests/test_cif_reader.py`.

### Scientific validation achieved

The dome-geometry pipeline was checked against the literature rather than
assumed correct. Taking the mid-point of each of the 38 transmembrane helices in
each protomer as a sample of the mid-membrane surface, recovering the three-fold
axis, and fitting a sphere gives:

| Structure | State | Radius of curvature | Dome depth | Excess area |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7WLT | curved, bilayer | **9.7 nm** | 4.9 nm | 256 nm² |
| 11YE | curved, PM vesicle | **10.4 nm** | 4.6 nm | 293 nm² |
| 8YEZ | human apo | 12.0 nm | 5.8 nm | 279 nm² |
| 8ZU3 | human + MDFIC | 12.5 nm | 5.4 nm | 270 nm² |
| 7WLU | flattened | 18.4 nm | 2.5 nm | 379 nm² |
| 11ZC | flat, PM vesicle | 21.6 nm | 3.5 nm | 335 nm² |

Published value for the closed state is **10.2 nm** (Haselwandter & MacKinnon
2018, eLife), and ~11.8 nm outside-in (Vaisey & MacKinnon 2026). Our 9.7 and
10.4 nm land squarely there, and the curved→flat contrast is unambiguous. C3
axis recovery is exact (120.00°, 0.00 Å RMSD). **This is now the standing
regression test for the geometry pipeline.**

*Known caveat:* the curved and flattened entries resolve different residue
ranges (7WLT 784–2547, 7WLU 576–2547), so their footprint radii are not directly
comparable. A fair comparison must restrict both to the commonly resolved
residues — to be implemented alongside the morphing code.

### Research

Six parallel literature-research agents were dispatched, writing dossiers to
`ref/research/`. The first wave hit an API session limit and was relaunched
against REST endpoints (Europe PMC, UniProt, RCSB, PubChem) instead of web
search, which had also been exhausted. The lipid-modulation dossier completed
and is a strong result: it supplies the membrane parameters (κ = 20–25 k_BT,
footprint decay λ = 14 nm, ΔA values), ligand potencies, and the important
2026 finding from Vaisey & MacKinnon that mechanical force alone is *not*
sufficient to gate PIEZO1 — a specific lipid cofactor is also required.

### Next

Sequence numbering map (human↔mouse), the annotation layer, then the elastic
network model, then the renderer.

## Variants & disease dossier — `ref/research/04_variants_disease.md`

Written 2026-08-05. 68-entry curated JSON variant table (22 GoF, 17 LoF, 8 VUS,
6 blood-group, 15 engineered) plus narrative. Every wild-type residue in the
table was validated programmatically against `ref/sequences/Q92508_human_PIEZO1.fasta`
— zero mismatches.

**The human↔mouse numbering map now exists** (Biopython global alignment,
BLOSUM62, 82.47% identity) and is tabulated in §8.2. The headline result is that
**the offset is not constant**: −6 at E756, −5 through the beam, **+16** across
THU9/anchor/outer-helix, and **+26** from the cap onward. Validated against the
known anchor mouse R2482 ≡ human R2456 (Ma et al. 2018). Traps to remember:
human E2496 ≠ mouse E2496 (mouse E2496 = human **E2470**); human S2446 = mouse
S2472; human E2117 = mouse E2133; human S1335 = mouse S1330.

**Two literature errors found and documented:** the Open Biology 2025 review
gives T2127's mouse equivalent as 2142 (correct: **2143**; the local alignment is
gapless), and Albuisson 2013 gives R1358P as c.4072G>C (ClinVar: **c.4073G>C**).
Also note a WebFetch summarisation hazard — the summariser fabricated a mouse
numbering column for that review; the raw XML had to be parsed directly to catch
it. Prefer parsing tables from XML over summarised fetches for numeric data.

**Blocking finding for the renderer/annotation layer:** the mutated residue is
often *absent* from its own structure. Verified against the local CIFs — all six
human PIEZO1 entries model chain A from residue **570** only, and **E756 is not
modelled in 9VMX**, nor **A1988 in 8ZU8 or 8YFC**. Only R2456 (8YFG) is present.
Residues 2060–2521 are continuously modelled, so the whole pore module renders
cleanly; G253, D669, G718, E756, C1064, K1877 and A1988 need AlphaFold and must
be flagged model-only in the UI.

Population genetics: gnomAD v4 gives pLI ≈ 0 and LOEUF 1.097 — PIEZO1 is
unconstrained for heterozygous LoF, exactly as expected for recessive LMPHM6.
The missense Z of −11.3 is *not* usable: synonymous Z is −14.1, so the mutational
model fails at this locus. ClinVar (2858 records) yields 133 sequence-level P/LP;
truncating alleles are spread uniformly while missense P/LP density is 6–8×
enriched in the pore module (inner helix 5.88 per 100 aa vs blade 0.69).

## Session 1, part 2 — renderer, GUI, validation

### The result that matters

An elastic network model built from the **closed** structure alone reproduces
the experimentally observed gating transition. Comparing curved 7WLT with
flattened 7WLU over the 1274 residues common to all six protomers (19.7 Å
trimer RMSD):

| | |
|---|---|
| Best single mode overlap | **0.705** (mode 3, symmetry A, collectivity 0.610) |
| Cumulative overlap over 40 modes | **0.964** |
| Best E-mode overlap | **0.0011** |
| Fraction of overlap² in A modes | **100.00%** |

The symmetry result is the part worth dwelling on. PIEZO1 is a C3 trimer, so
every mode carries an irreducible-representation label. Isotropic membrane
tension is itself C3-symmetric, so only A modes can couple to it at first
order. Every E mode scores essentially zero overlap with the real transition —
the analysis recovers the selection rule without being told about it. That is a
strong internal consistency check, and it means the app can tell a user which
modes are candidate gating coordinates on principle rather than by eye.

### Traps found by checking rather than trusting

**Protomer labels lie.** 7WLT and 7WLU label their three chains in opposite
rotational order around the symmetry axis. Superposing by chain label gave
71.2 Å RMSD instead of 19.7 Å, and the difference vector built from it was
meaningless — the first overlap calculation returned a misleading 0.213 with no
obvious sign of error. `match_protomers()` now always determines correspondence
by superposition, and a test pins it.

**Secondary structure came out 100% coil.** The distance criteria were fine;
the C-alpha pseudo-torsion had an inverted sign, giving −51° for the PIEZO1
inner helix where the IUPAC convention gives +51°, so the helix test never
fired. Fixed by correcting the cross-product order. PIEZO1 now assigns as 77%
helix / 10% strand / 13% coil, with OH, IH and the beam coiled coil all 100%
helix and the cap correctly β-rich.

**Camera framing by bounding sphere** left the molecule filling ~55% of the
viewport. PIEZO1 is a wide flat propeller, so the bounding-sphere radius badly
overestimates what needs to fit. `frame()` now projects into the current camera
orientation and solves for the exact containing distance.

**Disconnected networks.** Writing the ANM tests surfaced that a contact network
in several pieces contributes six rigid-body modes *per piece*. A model with a
detached fragment would have returned rigid-body motions as its lowest
functional modes — silent and thoroughly misleading. `ANM.n_components()` now
detects this and `calc_modes` discards `6 × n_components` by default.

### Research integration

All six literature agents completed on the second attempt (the first wave hit an
API session limit; relaunching them against REST endpoints rather than web
search worked). The most valuable outcome was **independent convergence**: an
agent's alignment of human and mouse PIEZO1 reproduced this project's offset map
block-for-block, and its Yoda1 pocket conversion (human A1718/A2075/A2078) and
selectivity residues (E2117/E2470) matched the values computed here exactly.

Two corrections were applied as a result. The "clasp" and "latch" domains were
**removed** — neither survived verification against primary sources, and
inventing boundaries would colour residues with false confidence. They were
replaced with two verifiable elements: the UniProt-annotated beam coiled coil
and the Piezo1.1 spliced segment. The anchor description was corrected:
P2113/F2114 is primarily the anchor apex brake on the inner helix, with the
cholesterol context secondary.

### Coverage honesty

Building the variant resource revealed something that shapes the whole UI: all
six human PIEZO1 structures model from residue 570 only, and **14 of 68 curated
variants — including the E756del malaria-associated allele — are resolved in no
human structure at all.** Only R2456 appears in its own structure (8YFG). The
viewer now greys those out, states the count, and warns on selection, rather
than highlighting nothing and letting the user assume it worked.

### Renderer

moderngl + QOpenGLWidget, OpenGL 4.1 core, ray-cast impostors. 31 599 atoms and
275k ribbon vertices render in 14–20 ms on an M1 Max. One Qt-specific trap worth
recording: `QOpenGLWidget` does **not** render to framebuffer 0, so moderngl
must be pointed at `defaultFramebufferObject()` every frame or nothing appears.

### Verification

43 tests, ~10 s. They pin the tokenizer's whitespace handling, the reversed-
handedness detection, dome curvature against the published 10.2 nm, the ANM
symmetry characters, the gating-overlap result itself, ten cross-species residue
equivalences (each also checked for matching amino-acid identity), and an
assertion that the numbering offset is *not* constant.

A scripted GUI smoke test (`scripts/screenshot_app.py`) drives the real
application and checks its outputs, so "the app still starts and computes" is a
test rather than a hope.

### Next

Helfrich membrane-footprint solver, tension-dependent Markov gating kinetics
(the Young et al. 2023 PNAS four-state model is fully parameterised in the
research dossier and is the one to implement), conformational morphing between
curved and flat endpoints, and pore-radius profiling.

## Session 1, part 3 — morphing, and the repo

`piezo1/structure/morph.py` interpolates between two experimental endpoints.
Three methods, each reporting its own geometric error so the cost of the
interpolation is visible rather than hidden:

| method | worst C-alpha bond error | note |
|---|---|---|
| linear | 2.94 A | the chord artefact |
| restrained | **0.00 A** | distances restored to interpolated targets |
| modal | 1.60 A | 30 modes capture 95.2% of the change |

The chord artefact is worth naming because it is not obvious: under
straight-line interpolation atoms cut chords through space, so C-alpha-C-alpha
distances contract wherever the local motion is rotational. PIEZO1's blades
swing through large arcs, so mid-path frames are measurably wrong. For
comparison, ProDy's `calcAdaptiveANM` was benchmarked on this same 3822-site
trimer at 18 minutes and still left bonds stretched to 5.39 A.

Dome geometry tracks along the restrained path — radius of curvature
9.2 -> 13.1 nm, dome depth 4.6 -> 2.7 nm, excess area 278 -> 316 nm2 — so the
physics follows the morph rather than being imposed on it.

**Refactor.** `main_window.py` reached 657 lines, past the project's 500-line
rule, so dome/mode handling moved to `ui/physics_controller.py` and morph
handling to `ui/morph_controller.py`; the window is now 364 lines. The split
introduced two bugs, both caught by re-running the scripted GUI test rather
than by assuming the move was safe: a guard still testing `hasattr` on an
attribute now initialised to `None`, and a method left with its pre-split name.
Mechanical refactors of GUI code need the smoke test run afterwards, every time.

**Final research agent** returned benchmarks that independently validated the
architecture: sparse ANM at N=7500 takes 4.4 s versus 311 s dense (71x); full
C3 block-diagonalisation would give only 1.76x on top of that, confirming the
decision to do symmetry *labelling* rather than symmetry-adapted solving;
ProDy's `imANM` is an O(N^2) Python loop and unusable at this scale;
MDAnalysis's `hole2` is an empty stub in 2.10 and HOLE has no arm64 build, so a
native pore profiler is required.

**Repository** published to github.com/gddickinson/piezo1-simulator (private),
eight commits, 86 tracked files. `ref/` and `data/` are git-ignored and fully
regenerable with `python -m piezo1.io.fetch`.

### State at end of session

Working: data layer, structure model, cross-species numbering, dome geometry,
elastic network models with C3 symmetry labelling, conformational morphing, the
renderer, and the GUI. 51 tests, ~15 s.

Next, in order of value: the tension-dependent Markov gating model (Young et al.
2023 PNAS four-state, fully parameterised in `ref/research/03a_kinetic_models.md`
— sigma_50 = 1.4, b = 0.8 mN/m, all rates given); the Helfrich membrane
footprint solver (1-D radial validates to 3.8e-3 against the exact K_0 in
0.9 ms, then revolve; lambda = 14 nm with kappa = 20 kT implies gamma =
0.42 mN/m); a native pore-radius profiler (a leash is mandatory — unconstrained
the probe sphere escapes to R = 6188 A); and the hybrid full-length model,
noting that AlphaFold **cannot** place residues 1-570 relative to the core
(PAE 25-29 A against a 31.75 A maximum), so PIEZO2 6KG7 is the better guide.
